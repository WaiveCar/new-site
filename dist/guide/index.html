<h2>Finding WaiveCars</h2>
<section>
  <p>Teardrops with lightning bolts are available WaiveCars.</p>
  <div>
    <dt><img src="icon-active-waivecar-2.png"></dt>
    <span>Green ones have a good charge appropriate for most uses.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src="icon-active-waivecar-1.png"></dt>
    <span>Yellow ones have a limited charge appropriate for short errands.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src="icon-active-waivecar-0.png"></dt>
    <span>Red ones have a very limited charge and are suitable for in-town trips.</span>
  </div>
  <p>Teardrops with white inner circles are places where you can find many WaiveCars 
  and end your booking at any charge (sometimes called "homebases").</p>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-homebase.png'></dt>
    <span><p>When it's blue, there's WaiveCars available here.</p><p>Tap on the icon to get a list of the WaiveCars.</p></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-homebase-nocars.png'></dt>
    <span>When it's grey, there's no WaiveCars available here.</span>
  </div>

<h2>During your ride</h2>
<section>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='user-location.png'></dt>
    <span>The blue circle with a blue ring is where you currently are.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='locked-car.png'></dt>
    <span><p>The car on top of the green circle with a lightning bolt shows where you have parked the WaiveCar during your booking.</p><p>You can use it to review the places you've gone or help you find your WaiveCar.</p></span>
  </div>

  <h3>Charging a WaiveCar</h3>
  <p>Teardrops with electric plugs are places where you can charge your WaiveCar during your booking.</p>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-station-free.png'></dt>
    <span>Green ones represent charging station that are <b>free</b> to use during your booking with the WaiveCar app.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-station.png'></dt>
    <span>Grey ones represent charging stations that cost money. The WaiveCar app does not know about all current charging options. The best one we've found is <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a>. WaiveCars can use "CCS/SAE" (Level 3) and "J-1772" (Level 2) plugs. The significant and meaningful difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is explained in the next section.
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-station-closed.png'></dt>
    <span>Chargers with known limited hours become red with a diagonal line 15 minutes before they close.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Choosing a Charger</h3>
  <p>Electric cars take significantly longer to refuel than gasoline cars.</p>
  <p>The time it takes to fuel greatly depends on the type of charger. When tapping on a free charger in the WaiveCar app, you'll
  see one or more of the following icons:</p>

  <div>
    <dt><img src='charger-slow.png'></dt>
    <span>The "Level 2" charger is the slower charge. It will fuel the vehicle about 15 miles worth for every hour it's plugged in.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='charger-fast.png'></dt>
    <span>The "Level 3" charger is significantly faster. It will fuel most of the vehicle in around 25 minutes. Unless you're really low and need a charge, it is generally worth the effort to wait for a Level 3.</span>
  </div>

  <p>To begin a free charge, after arriving at a supported charging station, find the fuel plug that has the same number on its screen as the number with the "#" symbol before it in the app.</p>

  <p>Plug it in and follow the instructions on the fueling station's screen. When the screen asks for an account or form of payment, tap the icon corresponding to the charger in the app. The app will communicate with the charger and WaiveCar will pick up the tab!</p>

  <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>

  <p>Charging plugs <em>usually get locked</em> when fueling WaiveCars! If the plug doesn't seem to come out, use the app to unlock the WaiveCar and it will also unlock the charger.</p>

  <p>Along with the above options, many WaiveCars have a slower "Level 1" charger in a carrying case in the back of the vehicle. These chargers can be plugged into a normal wall outlet and deliver a significantly slower charge, about 6 miles of fuel in one hour.  They are kept there for emergency situations to help avoid any recovery fees if you're running really low and can't find any better options.</p>

  <p>Please note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes charging stations have lines with long wait-times. Late morning and early weekday afternoons seems to be best times.</li>
    <li>Stations are first-come, first-serve and do not accept reservations.</li>
    <li>You <em><b>may not</b></em> end a booking plugged into a charging station. We don't want unbooked WaiveCars blocking others from using the station.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Finishing</h2>
<section>
  <p>You must be in the green to end a booking.</p>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='green-shape.png'></dt>
    <span> 
    <p>The green highlighted shapes are regions you can end your booking so long as your WaiveCar has at least 25 miles of charge and you follow the parking restrictions.</p>
    </span>
  </div>

  <p>Rectangles with a capital P that are not red are places to end your booking at any charge.</p>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='icon-hub.png'></dt>
    <span>Blue ones are lots owned by WaiveCar and can store many vehicles.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='parking-available.png'></dt>
    <span>Green ones are private parking spaces which have generously been made available by members of the WaiveCar community.
    <ul>
      <li>Green spaces must be reserved by tapping on them and following the instructions.</li>
      <li>Reservations expire after a few minutes, so it's best to not reserve until you're ready to end.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt><img src='parking-in-use.png'></dt>
    <span>Red ones with a diagonal line through it are occupied and in use. You can not end your booking at a red rectangle.</span>
  </div>
